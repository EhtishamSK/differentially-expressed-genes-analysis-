Gene Expression Analysis in Chile Pepper Cultivars for Disease Resistance.
This project investigates gene expression variations between two chile pepper cultivars—disease-resistant and susceptible—using root samples collected 24 hours post-inoculation. The analysis was conducted between March and April 2024, leveraging Linux and R for data processing and bioinformatics workflows.

Key Steps:
Directory Setup: Organized the project into separate folders for genome, RNA-seq data, and results.
Data Acquisition: Downloaded genome sequences and annotations from Ensembl Plants and transferred RNA-seq data using FileZilla.
Quality Control: Checked sequence quality with FastQC and trimmed reads using Trimmomatic for high-quality paired-end data.
Genome Alignment: Utilized genome and annotation files for downstream analysis (e.g., differential expression).
This repository provides the scripts and methodology for researchers interested in transcriptomics and disease resistance in crops.
